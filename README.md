## 🌌 Vision & Project

**Aesthesius Price Sentinel** is not merely a bot; it is a digital observer. Built upon **Anıl**'s backend philosophy, this system silently patrols complex e-commerce structures (such as Vatan Computer) 24/7.

When the target object (e.g., Samsung S25 FE) aligns with the strategic price point defined by **Aesthesius**, the system transmits an instant, encrypted intelligence signal (notification) directly to **Anıl** via the Telegram API.

## 🛠️ Architecture

Crafted with the perfectionist approach of **Aesthesius**, this tool is optimized for native performance on Arch Linux.

* **Engine:** Python 3.x
* **Observation (Scraping):** `BeautifulSoup4` & `Requests`
* **Communication:** Telegram Bot API
* **Cycle:** Custom Daemon Loop
