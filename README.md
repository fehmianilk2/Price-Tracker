## 🌌 Vision & Project

**Aesthesius Price Tracker** is a universal digital observer designed for the modern web. Architected by **Anıl**, this system abstracts the complexity of data tracking, allowing any user to monitor any product across various e-commerce platforms with precision.

It is not limited to a specific item or store. Whether for high-end electronics, market assets, or daily essentials, **Aesthesius** adapts to the user's need. Once a target URL and a strategic price point are defined, the sentinel silently patrols the web 24/7. Upon detecting the desired value, it transmits an instant, encrypted intelligence signal to the user via Telegram, ensuring that no opportunity is missed.
